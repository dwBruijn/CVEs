# My Recent CVEs

This repo contains my recent CVEs/publically disclosed vulnerabilities (usually not associated with any bug bounty program).

I always follow a responsible disclosure policy to avoid any unintended harm to end users.

## DISCLAIMER

I'm not responsible for any harm caused by the misuse of the content of this repo. I tend not to provide any ready-to-use exploits. I believe that known vulnerabilities should be made public because it's much easier to protect against threats you know exist than those you're unaware of.
